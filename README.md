## The problem

You need to get a random number.

## This solution

This is a function that calls `Math.random()`. This is just a temporary package
used for educational purposes.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save @kentcdodds/tmp-random-number-2
```

## Usage

```javascript
const randomNumber = require('@kentcdodds/tmp-random-number-2')
console.log(randomNumber(0, 1)) // logs a random number between 0 and 1
```

## Inspiration

This package was inspired by random awesomeness.
